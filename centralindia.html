Ghotul is a better-known event in tribal life and they have aroused considerable interest from anthropologists to study the tradition. Both boys and girls
 are allowed to spend a night out in the ghotul (kind of rest house), every week. Ghotuls are regarded as a shrine, built by Lingo Pen, a Gond (a tribe) cult hero. Here, the unmarried boys of the village learn songs 
 and dance from their leader. Besides, every week, there is a dance carnival as well in which the girls also take part. Moreover, It is treated like a pilgrimage.
Dussehra is celebrated with much enthusiasm in Jagdalpur every year.Major tourist centres in the state are Amarkantak, Banjari Baba, Bhoramdev,

The mighty Gwalior Fort was built in the 15th century by Raja Mansingh Tomar on a hilltop that overlooks the city. The outer wall of the fort stands two miles in length and 35 m in height. A steep road winds upwards to the fort, flanked by statues of the Jain Tirthankaras, carved into the rock face.

Man Mandir is the Fort's piece de resistance. The palace built by Man Singh Tomar is a delicate structure exhibiting a sense of joy and abandon through use of color, motif, and design. There are chambers for affairs of state as well as those for relaxation, adorned appropriately and ornately with carved animals, flowers, and the human form.

If Man Mandir reflects Man Singh's aesthetic sensibilities, Gujari Mahal speaks of his love. The courage and beauty of Mrignayani and her love with Raja Mansingh are now a part of popular folk tradition. The palace has been now converted in a museum and houses very good collection of Jain and Hindu artifacts.

Contrasting with the predominant north Indian style of architecture is the Teli-ka-Mandir. This temple is believed to the oldest in the Fort, built in the ninth century and Dravidian in form. The sculptures are distinctly north Indian. Some believed it was so named because it was built in the Telangana style; others say this was because it was built by telis (oil merchants). A more recent study ascribes it to Telap Raj, a prime minister of the region.

The Sas-Bahu temples, in another part of the Fort, are not, as people believe, dedicated to a mother-in-law (Sas) and daughter-in-law (Bahu). Sas-Bahu is the name traditionally given to two adjoining temples of different sizes. The larger of the two is profusely sculpted with graceful figures and intricate patterns. This is more apparent in the interior where, above the sculpted walls and pillars, an elaborately carved lotus adorns the roof.

The chhatris, memorials to former Scindia rulers, are executed in the typical Bundelkhandi style with conical spires and heavily carved exteriors.

At another point in the city is the tomb of Mohammad Ghaus. Although of little importance from a historical perspective, the sheer beauty of the tomb is breathtaking. The stone carving for which the skilled artisans of Gwalior were justly famous is apparent in the huge panels of lacy screen work, which combine with an interesting architectural design to create a delicate, ethereal appeal.

Adjacent is a small white, austere tomb. This is the memorial to Tansen, a famed musician, and one of the nine gems of the Mughal emperor Akbar's court.</p>

Bhopal has a number of tourist attractions. There are a number of important mosques, but the most revered is the Taj-ul-Masjid, which is the largest mosque in
 India. The Jama Masjid and the Moti Masjid of Bhopal are other important mosques built by the local Begums in the 19th century. Shaukat Mahal and Sadar Manzil,
 located in the chowk area, in the heart of the old walled city, are other important tourist attractions. While Shaukat Mahal is a strange mixture of Indo-Islamic and European style of architecture, Sadar Manzil is a hall used by the local rulers for public audience. Bhopal is famous for Bharat Bhavan, a marvel of modern architecture and a museum of tribal and contemporary art forms and breeding ground for traditional dance, music and drama. The Tribal Habitat or Manav Sangrahalaya (the Museum of Man), located on Shamala hills of Bhopal, is an open-air museum depicting tribal dwellings, from all parts of India. The tranquil Upper Lake and the Lower Lake are important tourist spots with boating and sailing facilities. The Government Archeological Museum near the Lower Lake, the chowk at the heart of the old city, Van Vihar local safari park near the Upper Lake, and the Aquarium are other places worth visiting within the city limits. The Lakshmi Narayan Temple (or the Birla Mandir) and the adjacent local museum on the Arera hills are other sites to be visited.</p>

<p>
One of the holiest of Hindu cities, Ujjain has a plethora of temples that are spread all over the town. The most notable are the Bhaironath (the liquor drinking deity) temple; Mangalnath temple, situated at the place where the first meridian is said to pass the earth; Chintaman Ganesh, the temple said to have been established by Lord Ram himself; Har Siddhi Mata, the family goddess of King Vikramaditya; and deep in the bazaar, Gopal Mandir, a Krishna temple. A popular local saying has it that even if one came with two cart loads of grain and offered only one handful at each temple one would still run short of offering.
<br>
While Mahakal is undoubtedly the presiding deity of Ujjain, the other gods of the Hindu pantheon are also well represented in the hundreds of other temples all over the town. One of the major attractions of the town is the Bhasma Aarti held every dawn at the Mahakal temple. In this ritual, the master of cosmic time is propitiated with ash from a cremation ground, the ash being symbolic of the end of a particular manifestation of existential time.
<br>
Apart from the temples, the other buildings of Ujjain merit far more than a casual look. "Its houses are like palaces and its palaces are like mountains," wrote Kalidasa, and even today that observation is not very far off the mark. Ujjain is quite simply a traveler's dream destination, one that should not be seen in hurry but savored slowly. </p>
