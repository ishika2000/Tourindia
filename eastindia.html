Built in 650 AD, Parashurameshwara Temple is one of the best examples of the Orissa style of temple architecture. This temple followed very rigid parameters set by the ritualistic books. The temple has some exquisite carvings and sculpture.

Vaital Deul (800 AD) has a double-storied wagon roof, which in turn is an influence of the Buddhist cave architecture. The interior of the temple has the image of Chamunda (an incarnation of Goddess Kali).

Mukteshwar Temple (7th-8th century AD) is one of the most ornated temples in the Bhubaneswar. The intricate carvings of the deities testify the influence of Hindu, Buddha, and Jain style of architecture. The carvings on the roof are specially striking.

The Rajarani Temple (1100 AD), which derives its name from the stone known as the Rajarani, was built earlier in comparison to the impressive Lingaraja. Set amongst picturesque paddy fields, the relatively small Rajarani temple is noted for its fascinating female figures portrayed in a stunning variety of amorous poses and moods.

Brahmeswara Temple (1050 AD) is situated around a kilometer east of the main road. The temple stands in a courtyard flanked by four smaller temples.

The 10th- or 11th-century Lingaraja temple of Bhubaneswar has been described as "the truest fusion of dream and reality." A rare masterpiece, the Lingaraja temple has been rated one of the finest examples of purely Hindu temple in India by Ferguson, the noted art critic and historian. Every inch of the surface of the 55-m-high Lingaraja temple is covered with elaborate carvings. Sculpture and architecture fused elegantly to create a perfect harmony. Devout pilgrims, who wish to go to the Jagannath temple at Puri, must first offer worship at the Lingaraja temple.

The Orissa State Museum is one of the best places to explore sculptures, stone inscriptions, lithic and bronze-age tools, rare copper plates, palm-leaf manuscripts, paintings, anthropological specimens, and musical instruments.

The Handicrafts Museum at Secretariat Road has a good collection of folk paintings, horn toys, brass castings, and sculptures.

The Tribal Museum deals with the various aspects of the tribal life and culture in Orissa.

Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand is a picturesque hill station still full of old world colonial charm. It is of special interest to those who are interested in anthropology for the Tribal Research Institute and museum is located here. It is well worth a visit for those who want to know more about the tribal life of Jharkhand.
<br>

<br>
The Kanke Dam is a delightful tourist spot that is regularly frequented by tourists. A few kilometers from it lies the famous 17th century Jagannath Temple.
<br>
Another interesting site is the War Cemetery, the smallest 'concentration' cemetery in India with a total of 708 burials. Located on the Ranchi - Hazaribagh road, it includes a soldier of the army of undivided India. The graves are well classified and deserve attention for some of the poignant epitaphs like "may some gentle hand in the far off land lay down a flower for us."
<br>

<br>
The Hazaribagh Wildlife Sanctuary is another important site in Uttarakhand. It is vying for a place in the international heritage list for its recent findings of rock paintings, caves, stone age tools and smelted iron slag that show a much early advent of the Iron Age than the theorized Chalcolithic age. Wild boar, sambar, nilgai, cheetal, and kakar can be sighted near waterholes at dusk here.
<br>
Netarhat is a beautiful sunset and sunrise point, a couple of hours from Betla. Rajrappa is famous for the "Ma Chhina Mastika" temple, where the River Bhera joins the Damodar, forming a 20 feet high waterfall. Boating facilities are available here.</p>

The southernmost tip of Indian mainland, apart from the stunning views has lots to explore. Following are the some of the popular tourist attractions in Kanyakumari.
<br>
Bhubaneswar-the state capital with its over a hundred temples-provides an ideal introduction to the rich cultural heritage of the state of Orissa. Visits to the Lingaraja Temple and the Rajarani Temple (11th century AD) are a must. Those interested in ancient temple architecture may visit the temples of Laxmaneswar, Satrughaneswar and Bharateswar (6th century AD), Parasurameswar and Swarnajaleswar (7th century AD), Vaital Deul (8th century AD), Brahmeswar (11th century AD) and Ananta Vasudeva (13th century AD)
<br>
While in Bhubaneswar, the Orissa State Museum, Tribal Research Museum and Handicrafts House should also be on the visitors' lists.
<br>
Nearby excursions (8 km) to the Khandagiri and Udayagiri caves belonging to the 1st-2nd century BC, to Dhauli (8 km) with the Buddhist Peace Pagoda constructed in 1972 and the Zoo and Botanical Gardens at Nandan Kanan (120 km) cater to a variety of interests.
<br>
One of the four religious centres in India, Puri in Orissa is famous for its Jagannath Temple. Other temples of interest here are the Gundicha, Lokanath and Tota Gopinath and tanks like Sweta Ganga and indradyumna.
<br>
Puri, a popular beach resort is of special attraction for visitors fond of swimming in the sea. Excursions to Balighai (8 km), a picnic spot and Satyabadi (20 km) with its shrine dedicated to Lord Sakshigopal are recommended.
<br>
With its famous Sun Temple, Konark is the high point of a visit to the Golden Triangle of Orissa. The temple, built in the 13th century and now in ruins, is replete with stone sculptures. The temple is one of the unrivalled technical marvels of ancient India.</p>

<p>
The fine white sands of Puri beach and the roar of the breakers rolling in from the Bay of Bengal have fascinated visitors throughout the years. The local fishermen, with their catamarans and wide-brimmed cane hats, are also expert masseurs. With excellent hotels and guesthouses, the Puri beach is an ideal holiday spot.
<br>
However, what attracts most the tourists to this place is the majestic temple of Jagannath. Even before one enters Puri, this 65-meter-high structure makes its presence felt. The 12th-century temple built by Chodaganga, to commemorate the shifting of his capital from south to central Orissa, stands in a compound on the Nilgiri Hill, and is surrounded by a 20-foot-high wall, within which lie several smaller shrines. A traditional porch, shrine, hall of offerings and a pillared hall of dance form the rest of this temple. Unfortunately, Jagannath is not open for non-Hindus, who must contend themselves viewing it from a vantage point, outside its precincts. 
<br>
Another place worth visiting is Ananda Bazar, the largest food market in the world.
<br>
Gundicha Mandir is one of the temples closely related to the festivity of the Rath Yatra of Puri. It is a holy place where God resides for seven days during the festival. This garden is regarded as the place of lord Jagannath's aunt.
<br>
Balighai Beach, 8 km from Puri, is at the mouth of the river Nuanai. It a popular picnic spot, fringed by lovely causarina trees.
<br>
Sakshi Gopal (literal meaning, the witness lord) is a place 20 km away from Puri where a life-size image of the child Krishna is being built. This was to commemorate the incident when lord Krishna came to this place as a witness to clear out a dispute of two Brahmans. Later it is said that lord liked this place so much that he decided to stay there for a while.
<br>
Another site to give a visit is the magnificent Atharnala Bridge, constructed during the 13th century.
<br>
Besides the places of the city, there are a number of tourist sites outside the city boundary.
<br>
Balighai, also known for its sea turtle research center, is located just 8 km away from the temple town.</p>

<p>
Kolhua is the first important place when one starts exploring Vaishali. There is a huge iron pillar beside a brick stupa here, believed to be constructed by King Ashoka. The pillar was constructed to commemorate the last sermon of the Buddha here. Near the pillar are ruins of a monastery and a large tank where the Buddha used to reside during his stay here.
<br>
The Vaishali Museum is a great place for the tourists interested in archeology. The museum houses an array of remains discovered at the various sites in Vaishali. Close to the museum is a circular tin shed covering the remnants of the stupa, which once housed the Buddha's funeral ashes.
<br>
At one side of the museum is the Abhishek Pushkarani or the coronation tank of the Lichchavi's. A little distance away is Raja Vishal Ka Garh, an excavated site believed to be the remains of the ancient parliament house where the federal assembly of the Lichchavi government gathered to discuss and regulate the ancient republic.
<br>
The Bawan Pokhar Temple, built during the Pala period, stands on the northern bank of a tank known as Bawan Pokhar and enshrines beautiful images of several Hindu gods.
<br>
A major attraction in Vaishali is the Vishwa Shanti Stupa (pillar of peace), one of the newest additions to this important site. This monument, built on the south bank of the coronation tank, is one of the highest in the world and has been built in collaboration with the Japanese government.</p>
